								<p>
									<strong>Tutorial Chairs:</strong> Anna Khoreva (anna.khoreva@bosch.com) and Meng Wang (wangmeng@hfut.edu.cn)  <br />
									<strong>Proposal Deadline:</strong> 11:59 pm (Pacific Standard Time) 20 December 2020   <br />
									<strong>Notification of Acceptance:</strong> 10 January 2021   <br />
									<strong>Posting Online (Camera Ready):</strong> 31 January 2021  <br />
									<strong>Submission:</strong> <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/MMASIA2020/">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/MMASIA2020/</a>
								</p>
							<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p>
									We solicit high quality proposals for tutorials to be held in conjunction with ACM Multimedia Asia 2020. 
									Tutorials will take place in parallel with the main conference (March 7-9 2021). 
								</p>
								<p>
									Tutorials should aim to address the state-of-the-art of research and development and to provide a comprehensive overview of specific topics in multimedia. 
									Tutorials can come in different focuses, depending on the area covered. 
									A good tutorial should be educational and instructive to provide in-depth introduction of particular pieces of work rather than just a cursory survey of techniques. It should also be of sufficient relevance and importance to attract significant interest from a wide audience in the multimedia community. 
									Although most courses are half-day offerings (3-4 hours including breaks), we also invite proposals for full-day courses (5-7 hours including breaks) provided that the topic merits the additional time and can be anticipated to generate sufficient interest from our community.
								</p>
							<h3>submission information</h3>
								<p>
									A tutorial proposal should be in a PDF document with no more than 3 pages (A4 format, font size 10, all inclusive). 
									The document should include the following information: 
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Tutorial title;  
									</li>									
									<li>
										Presenters’ names, titles, affiliations, emails and brief bio sketches;
									</li>
									<li>
										Motivation for having a tutorial on the proposed topic, explaining why the proposed tutorial is beneficial to the multimedia community and of high impact;
									</li>
									<li>
										Preference for half- or full-day event, and indicative breakdown of day; 
									</li>									
									<li>
										Course description with list of topics to be covered, along with a brief outline/schedule and important details;
									</li>
									<li>
										Expected target audience, in terms of both composition and estimated number of attendees;
									</li>									
									<li>
										List of citations and/or URLs to relevant publications and/or products by the organizers, and to other relevant related work;
									</li>
									<li>
										Description of and/or links to any planned materials or resources to be distributed to attendees. Materials must be released after the tutorial.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									Proposals should be submitted by 11:59 pm (Pacific Standard Time) Dec 20, 2020 via the CMT submission website: <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/MMASIA2020/">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/MMASIA2020/</a>
								</p>
							<h3>Evaluation criteria</h3>
								<p>
									Tutorial proposals will be evaluated by tutorial chairs on the basis of their estimated benefit to the community and their fit within the tutorials program as a whole. 
									Factors to be considered include: educational value, relevance, and audience appeal; suitability for presentation in a half or full day format; 
									expected attendance, and specialties of the intended audiences; track record, expertise and diversity of the organizers/speakers. 
									We encourage diversity in the organizing teams and speakers in all aspects, including gender, race, affiliation, geography, seniority, and perspective (e.g., advocates vs critics, academia vs industry).
								</p>
							<h3>Advertisement, budget, and registration</h3>
								<p>
									Tutorial organizers are responsible for the scientific organization and promotion of the event and the definition of their tutorial program. 
									ACM Multimedia Asia local arrangements will provide and pay for rooms, two coffee breaks per day (morning/afternoon) as well as basic equipment (chairs for registered attendees, video projector and screen). 
									All other activities with budget implications are the responsibility of tutorial organizers (e.g., meals, extra breaks, social functions, travel grants, etc). 
									Tutorial organizers will not have to deal with the participants’ registration or budget issues unless additional activities are planned. 
									Note that the tutorial speakers need to cover their own registration but will be paid a stipend (shared among speakers).
								</p>
