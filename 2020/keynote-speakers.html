                            <b>Abstract</b>: Given the large user base, deep user engagement level, and comprehensive coverage on various human activities, social media offers us a novel and effective lens for observing, monitoring, analyzing, and understanding human behaviors. In this talk, I will discuss our work on decoding human behaviors at both individual and collective levels using social media data from two perspectives: mobility and language. Through the lens of mobility, I will present our analogy between human activities across online communities and movements in the physical world. The analogy leads us to a series of findings on the striking similarities between the physical and cyber spaces. Through the lens of language, our work investigates how people's social identities affect their language use. Finally, I will also share interesting results on human behaviors at the population level, akin to the pulse of society.

                            <b>Abstract</b>: The fashion domain is a magnet for computer vision. New vision problems are emerging in step with the fashion industry's rapid evolution towards an online, social, and personalized business. Style models, trend forecasting, and recommendation all require visual understanding with rich detail and subtlety.  Importantly, not only can this visual understanding benefit individual users, but when analyzed across large-scale multi-modal data, it also can reveal how cultural factors and world events dynamically influence what people around the world wear.
                            
                            <br>
                            I will present our work developing computer vision methods for fashion. To begin, we explore how to discover styles from Web photos, so as to optimize mix-and-match wardrobes, suggest minimal edits to make an outfit more fashionable, and recommend clothing that flatters diverse human body shapes.  Next, turning to the world stage, we investigate fashion forecasting and influence.  Learned directly from photos, our models forecast what styles will be popular in the future, while accounting for how trends propagate in space and time across 44 major world cities.  Finally, building on this notion of fashion influence, we quantify which cultural factors (as captured by millions of news articles) most affect the clothes people choose to wear across a century of vintage photos.

                            <b>Abstract</b>: Computer Vision has been revolutionized by Machine Learning and in particular Deep Learning. For many problems which have been studied for decades, state-of-the art performance has dramatically improved by using artificial neural networks. However, these methods come with their own challenges concerning robustness and security. In this talk I will summarize some of our recent efforts in this space. E.g., while context information is essential for best performance, it might lead to overconfident or even wrong predictions of our methods. Another challenge is the robustness of these algorithms against adversarial attacks and what that might imply for the deployment e.g. in autonomous vehicles. Last, but not least, I will discuss new insights about reverse engineering deep neural networks as well as stealing the entire functionality of them cheaply. While we are clearly at the infancy of understanding robustness and security implications of deep neural networks, the talk aims to raise awareness as well as to motivate more researchers to address these important challenges.
