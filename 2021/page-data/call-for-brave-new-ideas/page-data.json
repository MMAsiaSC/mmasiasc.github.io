The Brave New Ideas (BNI) Track of ACM Multimedia Asia 2021 is calling for innovative papers leading to new prospects with the potential of long-lasting impact on multimedia research and practices. Submissions should be both scientifically rigorous and introduce brave and new ideas. “Brave” means that an idea has potential for high impact, providing an unconventional or out-of-the-box perspective, or fundamentally change the ways of addressing challenging problems in multimedia. “New” means that an idea has not yet been proposed. The component techniques and technologies may exist, but then their integration must be novel.</p>\n<p>In 2021, ACM Multimedia Asia covers diverse topics on multimedia research. More information is available <a href=\"./\">on the homepage</a>. We especially encourage the submission of interdisciplinary work crossing the boundaries of different disciplines with the help of multimedia technologies. We are also strongly looking forward to the submissions that propose novel ideas for “Multimedia interaction for online communication” to improve societal and economical activities especially during the difficult time facing the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>The “Brave New Idea” of the paper should have scientific rigour in one or a combination of three ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an extensive meta-review of existing work that will show that this idea can be productively pursued by the community.</li>\n<li>an extensive review of existing work that reveals a systematic shortcoming in the way that the research community has been addressing specific challenges. The BNI paper could thus propose a contrarian view.</li>\n<li>experimental validation of the paper’s BNI thesis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that it is not necessary that papers in this track have large-scale experimental results or comparisons to the state-of-the-art, since it is expected that large, publicly available datasets may not be available, and it is unlikely that approaches already exist to which the new idea can be compared. If there is a benchmark available addressing the problem it is almost certainly not a brave new idea.</p>\n<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>\n<p>Submissions must be 6 pages in length. For more details on the format, please see the submission instructions in the <a href=\"./call-for-papers/\">main conference call for papers</a>.</p>\n<p>Submissions will be reviewed by a set of at least three independent reviewers, and the decisions will be made on the basis of their feedback. Review criteria are: scientific impact, intellectual rigour, and a compelling case for the paper to be innovative in the sense described above.</p>\n<p><strong>Please submit your paper to the submission system <a href=\"https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/MMASIA2021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/MMASIA2021/</a></strong></p>\n<p>We expect BNI papers to be submitted directly to the BNI track. However, at the discretion of the Program Chairs, submissions to the regular full paper track may be recommended to the “Brave New Ideas” Program Committee for consideration.</p>\n<p>Important note for the authors: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to the published work.</p>\n<h2>Important Dates</h2>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong> The submission deadline is at 11:59 p.m. of the stated deadline date <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Anywhere on Earth</em></a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submission deadline: <strong>3 October, 2021</strong>.
