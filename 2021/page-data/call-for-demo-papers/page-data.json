Multimedia research focuses on technologies that enable the use and exchange of content integrating multiple perspectives of digital modalities, including images, text, video, audio (speech, music etc.), and other sensor data.</p>\n<p>ACM Multimedia Asia 2021 will provide demonstration sessions. Demos are intended as live and interactive proof of the presenters’research ideas and technological contributions, with the goal of providing multimedia researchers and practitioners the opportunity to showcase working multimedia systems, applications, prototypes, or proof-of-concepts. Such a setting allows conference attendants to view and interact first hand with live evidence of innovative solutions and ideas in the field of multimedia and to experience leading edge research at work.</p>\n<h2>Expected Contents</h2>\n<p>Submissions are encouraged in all areas related to multimedia, as described in ACM MMAsia 2021 general <a href=\"./call-for-papers\"><em>call for papers</em></a>.</p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Once accepted, demonstration presenters will be provided with a table, poster board, power outlet and wireless (shared) Internet. Demo presenters are expected to bring with themselves everything else needed for their demo presentations, such as hardware, laptops, sensors, PCs, etc. However if you have special requests such as larger space, special lighting conditions and so on, we will do our best to arrange them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Important note for the authors:</strong> The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library.

Each demo submission must contain a supplementary file, either in PowerPoint format (no more than 10 slides) or in video (no longer than 3 minutes) explaining to the jury:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the scientific or engineering concept behind the work?</li>\n<li>What is the novelty of the work and how is the work different from existing systems or techniques?</li>\n<li>What will be actually shown during the demo?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, a PDF document containing one page description about your demo booth configuration may be provided if you have special requests. Please note that the submission system accepts only one supplementary file (Max 10MB). Therefore you have to compress multiple files into one ZIP file for submitting the supplementary materials.
