Proposers with an innovative idea of a Multimedia Grand Challenge, should gather an organisational team with the capacity to carry out the organisation of a challenge, and submit a proposal according to the instructions below.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the Multimedia Grand Challenge is to engage the multimedia research community by establishing well-defined and objectively judged challenge problems intended to exercise the state-of-the-art methods and inspire future research directions. The key criteria for Grand Challenges are that they should be useful, interesting, and their solution should involve a series of research tasks over a long period of time, with pointers towards longer-term research.</p>\n<p><strong>A Multimedia Grand Challenge proposal should include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A brief description to explain why the challenge problem is important and relevant to the multimedia research community, industry, and society over the next 3-5 years or a longer horizon.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A description of a specific set of research tasks or sub-tasks to be carried out towards tackling the challenge problem in the long run.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An outline of current state-of-the-art techniques and why this Grand Challenge would help accelerate research in this important area.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Link to sites containing relevant datasets to be used for objective training and evaluation of the grand challenge tasks. Full appropriate documentation on the datasets should be provided or made accessible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A description of rigorously defined objective criteria and/or procedures on how the submissions will be evaluated or judged.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A commitment to publish and maintain a website related to their specific Grand Challenge containing the information, datasets, tasks for the Grand Challenge at least the next 3 years.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Work with ACM Multimedia Asia Conference organisers to publicise the Grand Challenge tasks to researchers for participation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Contact information of at least two organisers who will be responsible for organizing, publicizing, reviewing and judging the Grand Challenge submissions as described in the proposal.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note</strong> that although we ask organisers to express a multi-year commitment to their Grand Challenge, the Challenge will still undergo a new review each year. Priority will be given to Grand Challenges which have been successful in the past and are clearly contributing to continuity.</p>\n<h2>Submission Website</h2>\n<p>The grand challenge proposals should be submitted through: <a href=\"https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/MMASIA2021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/MMASIA2021/</em></a>.</p>\n<h2>Important Dates</h2>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong> The submission deadline is at 11:59 p.m. of the stated deadline date <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Anywhere on Earth</em></a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submission deadline: <strong>5 July, 2021</strong>.</li>\n<li>Notification of acceptance: <strong>18 July, 2021</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contacts</h2>\n<p>For any questions regarding the submission, please email the Grand Challenge Chairs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Shin’ichi Satoh</strong> (<a href=\"satoh@nii.ac.jp\">satoh@nii.ac.jp</a>), National Institute of Informatics, Japan</li>\n<li><strong>Jingkuan Song</strong> (<a href=\"jingkuan.song@gmail.com\">jingkuan.song@gmail.com</a>), University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, China</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Call for Grand Challenge Proposals","datePublished":"2021-06-28","dateModified":"2021-07-14","dateModifiedFormatted":"14 July, 2021","description":"Call for Grand Challenge Proposals has been closed.
