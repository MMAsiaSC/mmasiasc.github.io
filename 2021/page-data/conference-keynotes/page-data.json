We will present three works covering different aspects of multimedia analytics.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first work is about privacy protection against machines. Utilizing machine learning and big data, algorithms often act as a tool for privacy violation, by automatically selecting content with sensitive information, such as photos that contain faces or vehicle license plates. The key idea is to perturb images using adversarial machine learning to protect image attributes privacy, while ensuring the images are not degraded. We conducted an experimental study to explore factors that influence human sensitivity to visual changes, which led to the concept of a human sensitivity map. Using this map, a human-sensitivity-aware image perturbation model is developed that can subtly alter an image such that sensitive attributes like gender are misclassified.</li>\n<li>The second work concerns privacy-preserving analytics on images. Attributes such as emotions, gender and age in images and videos are important for many applications. Existing methods extract this information from faces in the images. However, faces raise serious privacy concerns as they reveal people’s identity. We first did an eye-tracking based human study of age, gender, and emotion prediction of people in images under various identity preserving scenarios - obfuscating eyes, lower face, head or the full face. Motivated by this study, we successfully developed a deep learning model for attributes prediction under privacy-preserving conditions and we present its results.</li>\n<li>The third work concerns training machine learning models where data sets cannot be shared due to privacy regulations (e.g., from medical studies). A simple yet unconventional approach for anonymized data synthesis can enable third parties to benefit from such valuable data. We propose learning implicitly from visually unrealistic, task-relevant stimuli, which are synthesized by exciting the neurons of a trained neural network. Neuronal excitation serves as a pseudo-generative model, and can be extended to inhibit representations that are associated with specific individuals, thus providing privacy. The stimuli data is then used to train new classification models. Experiments on MNIST and sleep apnea data show that these models offer protection against adversarial association and membership inference attacks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will end with a general discussion on privacy concerns related to multimedia analytics.</p>\n<h2>Keynote 2: Artificial Intelligence: Paving a Path to Digital Economy Transformation</h2>\n<!-- ### Presenter -->\n<div class=\"keynote-text\">\n    <div class=\"keynote-img\">\n        <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 251px; border: solid 0.75px #ddd\">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/2021/static/ea4e626ed263e964ff3ae40a0fc9a2ce/c6c63/yong_.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Yong Rui\" title=\"Yong Rui\" src=\"/2021/static/ea4e626ed263e964ff3ae40a0fc9a2ce/c6c63/yong_.jpg\" srcset=\"/2021/static/ea4e626ed263e964ff3ae40a0fc9a2ce/a6b4f/yong_.jpg 200w,\n/2021/static/ea4e626ed263e964ff3ae40a0fc9a2ce/c6c63/yong_.jpg 251w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 251px) 100vw, 251px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n    </div>\n    <!-- - **Title**: -->\n    <h3>Yong Rui</h3>\n    <!-- - **Date**: -->\n    <!-- - **Abstract**:  -->\n    <p>Lenovo Group</p>\n    <p>\n        Dr. Yong Rui is the Corporate CTO and Senior Vice President of Lenovo Group.

In this talk, we will discuss the challenges of 360-degree tile-based video streaming due to its large bandwidth and low latency demands and solutions to satisfy the demands, including semantic-aware description of 360-degree videos’ viewing patterns, rate adaptation of tiled videos and view prediction techniques to enable interactive viewing via Head-Mounted Displays. Especially, we will discuss the concept of navigation graphs to <strong>(a).</strong> capture salient objects and events as well as viewing patterns of users, and <strong>(b).</strong> map them into efficient tile-based streaming and viewing experience. We will show how navigation graphs are serving as models to capture diverse semantic content and viewing behaviors in the temporal and spatial domains. Experimental results show that navigation graphs, provided jointly with Media Presentation Descriptors, can assist in efficient solutions of the bandwidth and latency challenges associated with view prediction and user’s interactive viewing. We will also discuss next challenges that future viewing patterns and streaming paradigms will bring as the integration of 360-degree videos, 2D/3D videos, and volumetric media in augmented reality applications is coming.</p>\n<div class=\"note\">\n    <p>* Joint work with Jounsup Park, Michael Zink, Ramesh Sitaraman, Qian Zhou, Bo Chen, Mingyuan Wu, John Murray, Ayush Sarkar, Eric Lee, Yinjie Zhang </p>\n</div>\n<style>\n    .keynote-text {\n        text-align: left;\n    }\n    .keynote-img {\n        float: none;\n        margin-right: 2rem;\n        margin-bottom: 1rem;\n        width: 250px;\n    }\n    .note {\n        font-size: 14px;\n        color: grey;\n    }\n\n    @media (min-width: 768px) {\n        .keynote-text {\n            text-align: justify;\n        }\n        .keynote-img {\n            float: left;\n        }\n    }\n</style>","frontmatter":{"title":"Conference Keynotes","datePublished":"2021-11-08","dateModified":"2021-11-14","dateModifiedFormatted":"14 November, 2021","description":"ACM MM Asia Conference Keynotes have been updated.
