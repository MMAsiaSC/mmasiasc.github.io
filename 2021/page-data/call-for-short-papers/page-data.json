ACM Multimedia Asia 2021 calls for short research papers presenting novel theoretical and algorithmic solutions addressing problems across the domain of multimedia and related applications. The conference also calls for short papers presenting novel ideas and promising (preliminary) results in realizing these ideas.</p>\n<p>Short papers provide an opportunity to describe significant novel work in progress or multimedia research. Compared to full papers, their contribution may be narrower in scope, be applied to a narrower set of application domains, or have weaker empirical support than that expected for a full paper. Submissions that are likely to generate discussions in new and emerging areas of multimedia are especially encouraged.</p>\n<h2>Expected Contents</h2>\n<p>Submissions are encouraged in all areas related to multimedia, as described in ACM MMAsia 2021 general <a href=\"./call-for-papers\"><em>call for papers</em></a></p>\n<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>\n<p>The short papers should be submitted through <a href=\"https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/MMASIA2021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/MMASIA2021/</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Submissions will be peer-reviewed, and accepted short papers will be published in the conference proceeding.
