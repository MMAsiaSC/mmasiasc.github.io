                <span>
                    Poster and Demo papers will be presented on-site and virtually simultaneously. For each poster and demo paper, we ask presenters to upload a video as well as a slide of their presentation before the conference. The duration of your pre-recorded presentation video should not exceed 3 minutes. Please upload your slides and pre-recorded videos to your personal cloud storage (Google Drive or OneDrive) and ensure that download permissions are enabled. After that, please fill the form <a href="https://4eyes.io/s/dFl7H/"><span class="selector">https://4eyes.io/s/dFl7H/</span></a> before November 28, 2023 (23:59 AOE). The uploaded presentation videos and slides will be placed in the Gather Town space, and all attendees can freely interact with the authors online.
                    <br><br>
                    For on-site poster/demo presenters, in addition to the pre-recodered presentation video and slides, please also prepare a physical poster that will be hung in the Multifunction room (1F). There, you will find the poster/demo board map, which you should check to identify the poster stand and demo area assigned to your paper ID. Please check the <a href="http://www.mmasia2023.org/program.html"><span class="selector">Conference Program</span></a> to see when your poster/demo is scheduled. You should be next to your poster/demo in your corresponding session. We suggest that you hang your poster and set up your demo system before 12:00 pm on the day of your poster/demo.
                    <br><br>
                    Each physical demo will be provided with a poster board (approximately 100cm (width) x 250 cm (height)), a table (approximately 100 (width) x 90 (height) x 50 (depth) cm), wireless internet and an electrical outlet. You need to bring any other equipment by yourself. Please pack up your demo and your poster at the end of the demo session. If you have further questions, please contact [service.mmasia2023@gmail.com].
