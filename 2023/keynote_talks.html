                    <span class="h5"><br>Image Super-Resolution (SR), one of the important computer vision technologies for upscaling Low-Resolution (LR) images to High-Resolution (HR), is gaining significance with the proliferation of online broadcasting, streaming services, and social media platforms. However, current SR methods fall short in real-world applications—they often lack adaptability to various image degradations and constraints on output shapes and dimensions. In this talk, we aim to address these shortcomings by introducing practical strategies to diversify the application of SR to accommodate any input and output specifications. To handle the array of degradation encountered in real LR images, we present a novel GAN-based technique, Adaptive Data Loss (ADL), which facilitates the unsupervised learning of degradation types. Furthermore, we introduce SRWarp, an innovative SR model capable of generating images of any desired shape. We have integrated both ADL and SRWarp into a cohesive framework, SelfWarp, which is adept at executing complex image transformation in real-world SR without the need for matched training pairs. Our empirical results showcase the ability of our novel SR algorithms to enhance real-world imaging tasks effectively.</span>

                    <span class="bold600"><br>Talk Abstract: </span>
                    <span class="h5"><br>Visual computing, traditionally, is a generic term for all computer science disciplines dealing with images, videos, and other types of visual data. These disciplines mainly include computer graphics, image processing, visualization, computer vision, virtual and augmented reality, and video analytics. This talk shall analyze contemporary visual computing systems from several systematic perspectives. First, contemporary visual data acquisition has shifted from the laboratory in the early days to the fields in recent years with new technical challenges emerging on the visual sensing front. Second, massive visual data acquired for a very diverse range of applications require high-performance computation of visual data via cloud computing. Such extension of visual computing to both the front-end and the back-end of the contemporary system now demands pervasive networking to effectively transport such volumetric visual data back and forth. Therefore, the networking of visual data has now become a key component in the new paradigm of contemporary visual computing systems which has not been adequately studied before. The investigation of visual computing systems now needs to be critically deepened to facilitate the researchers to traverse across new domains of exploitation. Several examples of emerging applications with unique design principles will be presented to illustrate the technical challenges we are facing and the potential impacts that contemporary visual computing systems are capable of producing.</span>

                    <span class="h5">My lab's research goal is to elevate computer vision into a truly
                        intelligent perceptual modality for computers. Towards this goal, our
                        research centers on three thrusts:human modeling and behavior
                        analysis; appearance modeling, inverse rendering, and material
                        recognition; and physics-based vision and computational photography.
                        Our research finds applications in AR/VR, graphics, HCI, and robotics,
                        and our current focus is autonomous driving, driving assistance,
                        elderly care, and assisted living. In this talk, I will discuss our
                        recent works on using passive observations from static cameras to
                        detect and estimate human behaviors that reflect their internal
                        states. I will also introduce our works on what we can tell about the
                        road from a car-mounted camera.</span><br>

                        professor at the Department of Intelligence Science and Technology,
                        Kyoto University. Before joining Kyoto University in 2018, he was a
                        professor with the Department of Computer Science, Drexel University.
                        His primary research interests lie in computer vision and machine
                        learning, including appearance modeling and material recognition,
